## FAQ

### How to best use this guide?

Read this guide alongside the course's lecture slides. Whenever you get stuck with content presented in lecture, come back and read this guide for additional information.

### I've heard Prof. Joel Ross has his lecture notes posted on GitHub. How is this different?

I try to keep the explanations of key ideas and other information very simple here.

Professor Joel Ross's [Android Development: Lecture Notes](https://info448-s17.github.io/lecture-notes/) are super great and useful, but I think it's a bit too formal and technical.
