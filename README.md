# INFO 448 Mobile Development Android

## About this guide

The world of mobile development is huge and difficult to navigate, especially for beginners who are interested in launching a career or an app in popular stores like the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

As a TA for this course, I've decided to create a guide that offers user-friendly resources, such as concept explanation, useful articles, and hints to homework assignments. This guide also tries to present information in [layman's term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_English) as much as possible. This will ensure that any programmer can understand the context in an easier way.

This guide serves as an additional resource for students who are enrolled in the **INFO 448 Mobile Development: Android** course.

## FAQ

### What kind of content does the guide include?

- Important concepts that are explained in layman's term
- Hints for each homework assignment
- Additional resources to take your development skill beyond this class

### How to best use this guide?

Read this guide alongside the course's lecture slides. Whenever you get stuck with content presented in lecture, come back and read this guide for additional information.

### I've heard Prof. Joel Ross has his lecture notes posted on GitHub. How is this different?

I try to keep the explanations of key ideas and other information very simple here. 

Professor Joel Ross's [Android Development: Lecture Notes](https://info448-s17.github.io/lecture-notes/) are super great and useful, but I think it's a bit too formal and technical.

### Must I use this?

Nope. But I recommend you "star" this repository for easy references.

### Can I reproduce/fork/share this repository?

Do as you wish. This massive guide is created to help you all.

### I see a typo or mistake in this guide

Feel free to make an edit and submit a pull request. I'll take a look at it.
