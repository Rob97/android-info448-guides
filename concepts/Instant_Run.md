# Instant Run

Imagine the pain of making some tiny code editing, hit the Save button, and then Run the app to build and test if the edit you've made actually worked. Instant Run helps by making it faster to see the changes you've made to your app.

When set to on, **Instant Run** will speed up any changes you've made to the code of your app and you can preview that change almost instantly on your virtual or physical device.

**So how do you know that Instant Run is turned on?** When a file has been edited, there will a lightning bolt icon appearing next to the Play button. That indicates that Instant Run is taking effect.
