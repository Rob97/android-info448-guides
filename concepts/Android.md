# Android

Like iOS (by Apple), Android is also a mobile operating system that runs on the devices you use to make phone calls, chat with friends, and take beautiful photos.

## History

**2003** - Android Inc. was founded as a project to develop an advance mobile operating system.

**2005** - Google acquired the company. The search giant began entering the mobile market that year.

**2008** - T-Mobile G1 device was released. It was the first Android-powered device that came with Android API version 1.0.

From that year forward, Android constantly releases new versions of its operating system.

## Version

It's funny when you observe the names of each Android operating system that the Android team at Google uses. Each name is a dessert!

Back in 2008 when the T-Mobile G1 was released, the software running the device was called Android 1.0. Since then the names were **Cupcake** (2009), **Donut** (2009), **Eclair** (2009), **Froyo** (2010), **Gingerbread** (2010), **Honeycomb** (2011), **Ice Cream Sandwich** (2011), **Jelly Bean** (2012), **Kit Kat** (2013), **Lollipop** (2014), **Marshmallow** (2015), **Nougat** (2016), and **Oreo** (2017).

Each major/minor releases adds more features and capabilities to the software. It also enhances security and privacy, making sure the data on your phone is safe and encrypted.

What do you guys think the name of the next Android release will be? ðŸ˜ƒ

## Into the Future (Hint: Kotlin)

If you have never heard of Kotlin before, now might be a good time. **Kotlin** is a new programming language that will replace Java as the default programming language to create Android apps.

Companies like Pinterest, Uber, and Udacity are adopting Kotlin into their projects too.

**But why switched?** Java is a great language, no doubt. But most people think that Java is a "too verbose" language. It is too descriptive. You need to write a lot of code even for something like creating a class or a function. Plus, Kotlin provided more security too.
