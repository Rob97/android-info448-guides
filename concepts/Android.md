# Android

It's the operating system that allows you make phone calls, chat with friends, and take beautiful photos.

Well, it's more than just that. It's an operating system that is very similar to Apple's iOS.

Here's a brief walkthrough of how Android get to where it is today.

## History

**2003** - Android Inc. was founded as a project to develop an advance mobile operating system.

**2005** - Google acquired the company. The search giant began entering the mobile market that year.

**2008** - T-Mobile G1 device was released. It was the first Android-powered device that came with Android API version 1.0.

From that year forward, Android constantly releases new versions of its operating system.

## Version

Dessert! Each released version is a name of a dessert!

Back in 2008 when the T-Mobile G1 was released, the software running the device was called Android 1.0.

Since then the names were

- **Cupcake** (2009)
- **Donut** (2009)
- **Eclair** (2009)
- **Froyo** (2010)
- **Gingerbread** (2010)
- **Honeycomb** (2011)
- **Ice Cream Sandwich** (2011)
- **Jelly Bean** (2012)
- **Kit Kat** (2013)
- **Lollipop** (2014)
- **Marshmallow** (2015)
- **Nougat** (2016)
- **Oreo** (2017)

It's a good idea to update your app to the latest version that is available. A new version has more features, tighter security, and so on!

Fun thing to ask: What's going to be the name for the next release?

A little extra topic:

## Kotlin

If you have never heard of Kotlin before, now might be a good time. **Kotlin** is a new programming language that will replace Java as the default programming language to create Android apps.

Companies like Pinterest, Uber, and Udacity are adopting Kotlin into their projects too.

**But why switched?** 

Java is a great language, no doubt. But most people think that Java is a "too verbose" language. It is too descriptive. You need to write a lot of code even for something like creating a class or a function. Plus, Kotlin provided more security too.
