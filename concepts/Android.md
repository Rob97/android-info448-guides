Here's a brief walkthrough of how Android get to where it is today.

## History

**2003** - Android Inc. was founded as a project to develop an advance mobile operating system.

**2005** - Google acquired the company. The search giant began entering the mobile market that year.

**2008** - T-Mobile G1 device was released. It was the first Android-powered device that came with Android API version 1.0.

From that year forward, Android constantly releases new versions of its operating system.

## Version

Dessert! Each released version is a name of a dessert!

Back in 2008 when the T-Mobile G1 was released, the software running the device was called Android 1.0.

Since then the names were

- **Cupcake** (2009)
- **Donut** (2009)
- **Eclair** (2009)
- **Froyo** (2010)
- **Gingerbread** (2010)
- **Honeycomb** (2011)
- **Ice Cream Sandwich** (2011)
- **Jelly Bean** (2012)
- **Kit Kat** (2013)
- **Lollipop** (2014)
- **Marshmallow** (2015)
- **Nougat** (2016)
- **Oreo** (2017)

It's a good idea to update your app to the latest version that is available. A new version has more features, tighter security, and so on!

Fun thing to ask: What's going to be the name for the next release?
