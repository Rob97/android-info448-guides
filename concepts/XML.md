# XML

Android uses XML (**E*X*tensible *M*arkup *L*anguage**) to shape how our app's screens and components will look like.

In HTML, you get to create your own XML tags too. But in Android, things are a little bit more strict. There's a set of tags that you can use in order to create great interface for your own app.
